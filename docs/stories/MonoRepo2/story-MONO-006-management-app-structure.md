### Routing Configuration
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    redirectTo: '/dashboard',
    pathMatch: 'full'
  },
  {
    path: 'dashboard',
    loadChildren: () => import('./features/dashboard/dashboard.module')
      .then(m => m.DashboardModule),
    canActivate: [AuthGuard]
  },
  {
    path: 'users',
    loadChildren: () => import('./features/users/users.module')
      .then(m => m.UsersModule),
    canActivate: [AuthGuard, RoleGuard],
    data: { roles: ['Admin', 'Manager'] }
  },
  // Additional routes...
];
```

### Layout Component Requirements
- **Header:** Navigation with user menu and logout
- **Sidebar:** Collapsible navigation menu
- **Main Content:** Router outlet for feature modules
- **Footer:** Basic application information

### Target User Roles
- **System Administrator:** Full access to all management features
- **Department Manager:** Access to department-specific data and reports
- **Supervisor:** Limited access to team management features

## Feature Module Placeholders

### Dashboard Module
- [ ] Basic dashboard layout
- [ ] Key metrics widgets (placeholders)
- [ ] Recent activity feed (placeholder)
- [ ] Quick action buttons

### Users Module
- [ ] User list view (placeholder)
- [ ] User detail view (placeholder)
- [ ] Role management (placeholder)
- [ ] Access control settings (placeholder)

### Reports Module
- [ ] Reports dashboard (placeholder)
- [ ] Report generation interface (placeholder)
- [ ] Export functionality (placeholder)

### Settings Module
- [ ] Application settings (placeholder)
- [ ] System configuration (placeholder)
- [ ] Audit logs (placeholder)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Management-app builds and serves successfully
- [ ] Basic navigation and routing working
- [ ] Shared libraries properly integrated
- [ ] Authentication guard protecting routes
- [ ] Consistent styling with design system
- [ ] Placeholder components for all planned features

## Future Considerations
- **Advanced Features:** Real-time notifications, advanced reporting
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Tablet and mobile optimization
- **Accessibility:** WCAG compliance for management interface
- **Performance:** Lazy loading and code splitting optimization

## Notes
- Focus on structure and foundation, not feature implementation
- Ensure consistent user experience with gutachter-app
- Plan for role-based access control from the start
- Consider internationalization for multi-language support
